# Roller Madness - week 4

This is the 4th and last week project for the course [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development/)


## Assignment summary

In this assignment, you will complete the Box Shooter Unity3D project, which will demonstrate your understanding of the creating a complex game system through the use of custom written scripts in C#, using code to dynamically modify gameObjects and components, creating user interface elements, creating visual polish through the use of particles, effects, and animations, triggering animations through code and the animator, building the project, and packaging the project for sharing with the peer review system.

### Instructions

- [x] Follow along with the videos that accompany this module to build the foundation of your game.
- [x] Create an interesting second level of the game. There should be some modifications over the first level. The modifications can be visual, auditory, or gameplay changes. For example, you could include a new target type that behaves in a different way or more visual feedback in the interface based on the type of target that you hit.
- [x] Make it so you can move from the level 1 scene to the level 2 scene after reaching an achievable score, such as 50 points. Don’t make it too hard to move from Level1 to Level2 for the peer reviewers. NOTE: You can make a “Next Level” button similar to the “Play Again” button. You will need to make a new NextLevel script, similar to the “PlayAgain” script.
- [x] Create a WebGL build of the project with the resulting files within a folder called “WebGL” located within a "Builds" folder at the top-level of your project folder.
- [x] Create a compressed (zip archive) of your project folder.
- [x] Upload the resulting zip archive for peer review.

Optional items:

- [ ] Modify the design of Level1.
- [ ] Replace the sound effects to update the sound design of the game.
- [x] Replace the textures and/or models to update the visual aesthetics of the game.
- [x] Do any other modifications to make your game interesting and fun to play.

NOTE: Google Chrome no longer supports plug-ins, so you will need to use another browser such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer with the Unity3D Web Player installed. The Web Player is installed by default when you install Unity.

### Review Criteria

- (5 points) "WebGL" build is included in the project folder and works as expected.
- (5 points) Level1 works as expected. That is, you can start the game, play it, lose the game, and play again.
- (5 points) Level2 works as expected. That is, you can move from Level1 to Level2, play it, lose the game, play again (Level2), or restart the game (back to Level1)
- (5 points) Project can be opened in Unity3D Editor.
- (5 points) Project Assets are organized into logical folders, such as “Scenes”, “Materials”, “Textures”, “Scripts”, “Sound”, “Standard Assets”, and filenames.
- (5 points) The scene hierarchy is organized and includes logically named gameObjects.

Please note that some versions of Windows cannot open files zipped on a Mac without using a third-party tool such as 7-zip code>http://7-zip.org. If you are using Windows and cannot open someone's submitted work and are unable to use a tool like 7-zip, skip that submission and write in the comment box 'Cannot open zip archive.'
